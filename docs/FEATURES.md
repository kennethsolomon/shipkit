# ShipKit Feature Specifications

Platform-agnostic feature specifications for ShipKit skills and commands.

## How to Use

Each spec in `docs/sk:features/` documents a skill or command: what it reads, what it produces, its business logic, hard rules, edge cases, and UI behavior. Specs are the source of truth for understanding *how* a skill works — the SKILL.md files are the *implementation* contract.

Update specs after shipping changes: `/sk:features` auto-detects what changed.
