## What's New (v3.16.0 — March 2026)

**Formal Agent Definitions, Path-Scoped Rules, and 2 new skills:**

- **`.claude/agents/`** — 6 formal agent definitions (backend-dev, frontend-dev, qa-engineer, security-reviewer, code-reviewer, debugger) with `memory: project`, `isolation: worktree`, and `background: true` where appropriate. `/sk:setup-claude` deploys these to every new project.
- **`.claude/rules/`** — 6 path-scoped rule files that auto-activate in Claude Code when you edit matching files: `laravel.md`, `react.md`, `vue.md`, `tests.md`, `api.md`, `migrations.md`. Stack-relevant rules are deployed by `/sk:setup-claude` automatically.
- **`/sk:ci`** — Set up GitHub Actions or GitLab CI with Claude Code workflows: auto PR review, issue triage, nightly security audit, release automation. Supports enterprise setups (AWS Bedrock OIDC, Google Vertex AI Workload Identity).
- **`/sk:plugin`** — Package your project-level customizations (skills, agents, hooks) into a distributable Claude Code plugin with a `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` manifest.
- **Skill frontmatter upgrades** — model routing (`haiku` for lightweight skills, `sonnet` for analysis), `disable-model-invocation: true` on side-effect skills (commit, release, branch), `context: fork` on expensive standalone skills (seo-audit, accessibility, reverse-doc).
- **Bug fix** — `allowed_tools` → `allowed-tools` (underscore typo silently ignored by Claude Code) fixed in 7 skills + all agent templates.

## What is ShipKit?

ShipKit turns Claude Code into a disciplined development partner. Instead of "write some code," every feature goes through:

**Plan** → **Build (TDD)** → **Quality Gates** → **Ship**

Each gate must pass before the next step. Lint fails? Fix it. Tests don't cover new code? Write them. Security issues? They block the PR. Quality is structural, not optional.

ShipKit auto-detects your stack — linters, test runners, frameworks, package managers. No configuration needed.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install
npm install -g @kennethsolomon/shipkit && shipkit

# 2. Bootstrap your project (run once)
/sk:setup-claude

# 3. Start building
/sk:start
```

That's it. `/sk:setup-claude` creates your project scaffolding: planning files, lifecycle hooks, path-scoped coding rules, and a persistent statusline — all auto-configured for your stack.

`/sk:start` is the recommended entry point — it classifies your task and routes you to the optimal flow automatically. You can also jump directly to `/sk:brainstorm`, `/sk:debug`, or any other flow entry point.

### Updating ShipKit

```bash
# Update the package
npm install -g @kennethsolomon/shipkit && shipkit

# Then in each project, update CLAUDE.md + deploy new hooks:
/sk:setup-optimizer
```

`shipkit` re-installs all skills and commands globally. `/sk:setup-optimizer` updates each project's CLAUDE.md with new commands and deploys any missing hooks.

---

## Lifecycle Hooks

`/sk:setup-claude` installs lifecycle hooks that automate common tasks. Core hooks are always installed; enhanced hooks are opt-in.

**Core hooks (always installed):**
| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `session-start` | SessionStart | Loads branch, recent commits, tech debt, code health |
| `session-stop` | Stop | Logs session accomplishments to `tasks/progress.md` |
| `pre-compact` | PreCompact | Saves git state before context compression |
| `validate-commit` | PreToolUse (git commit) | Validates conventional commit format, detects secrets |
| `validate-push` | PreToolUse (git push) | Warns before pushing to protected branches |
| `log-agent` | SubagentStart | Logs sub-agent invocations to `tasks/agent-audit.log` |

**Enhanced hooks (opt-in via `/sk:setup-claude` or `/sk:setup-optimizer`):**
| Hook | Event | What it does |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `config-protection` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | Blocks modifications to linter/formatter configs |
| `post-edit-format` | PostToolUse (Edit) | Auto-formats with Biome/Prettier/Pint/gofmt after edits |
| `console-log-warning` | Stop | Warns about `console.log`, `dd()`, `var_dump()` in modified files |
| `suggest-compact` | PreToolUse (Edit/Write) | Suggests `/compact` after 50+ tool calls |
| `cost-tracker` | Stop | Logs session metadata to `.claude/sessions/cost-log.jsonl` |
| `safety-guard` | PreToolUse (Bash/Edit/Write) | Enforces `/sk:safety-guard` freeze/careful mode |

---

## Formal Agent Definitions

`/sk:setup-claude` deploys 13 agent definitions to `.claude/agents/` — specialized sub-agents with `memory`, `model`, `tools`, and `isolation` pre-configured. Invoke any agent by mentioning its name in Claude Code.

**Implementation agents** — build things:

| Agent | Memory | Isolation | When to use |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `backend-dev` | project | worktree | Parallel backend work in `/sk:team` — API, services, models |
| `frontend-dev` | project | worktree | Parallel frontend work in `/sk:team` — components, pages, state |
| `mobile-dev` | project | worktree | React Native / Expo / Flutter — mobile-specific patterns and store prep |

**Quality agents** — find and fix problems:

| Agent | Memory | Isolation | When to use |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `qa-engineer` | project | background | Write E2E scenarios while other agents implement |
| `code-reviewer` | project | — | 7-dimension review after implementation (read-only) |
| `security-reviewer` | user | — | OWASP audit before shipping sensitive changes (read-only) |
| `performance-optimizer` | project | worktree | When `/sk:perf` finds Critical/High issues — finds AND fixes them |

**Design agents** — plan before building:

| Agent | Memory | Isolation | When to use |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `architect` | project | — | Before `/sk:write-plan` on complex tasks — proposes options with trade-offs |
| `database-architect` | project | — | Before `/sk:schema-migrate` — migration safety analysis and index recommendations |

**Operations agents** — infrastructure and maintenance:

| Agent | Memory | Isolation | When to use |
|-------|--------|-----------|------------|
| `devops-engineer` | project | worktree | CI/CD pipelines, Docker, deployment config — use with `/sk:ci` |
| `debugger` | project | — | Structured root-cause analysis — use with `/sk:debug` |
| `refactor-specialist` | project | worktree | Behavior-preserving cleanups — tests must pass before AND after |
| `tech-writer` | project | — | README, API docs, architecture docs from existing code |

`memory: project` — agent accumulates knowledge across sessions for that project. `isolation: worktree` — works in a separate git worktree, safe for risky changes. `background: true` — runs without blocking your conversation.

---

## Path-Scoped Rules

`/sk:setup-claude` installs coding rule files in `.claude/rules/` that Claude Code auto-activates when you open or edit matching files — no manual context loading needed.

| Rule file | Activates when editing | What it enforces |
|-----------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `laravel.md` | `app/**/*.php`, `routes/**`, `config/**` | Laravel conventions, service containers, Eloquent patterns |
| `react.md` | `**/*.tsx`, `**/*.jsx`, `src/**/*.ts` | Hooks rules, component patterns, TypeScript strictness |
| `vue.md` | `**/*.vue`, `resources/js/**/*.ts` | Composition API only, `<script setup>`, Pinia patterns |
| `tests.md` | `tests/**`, `**/*.test.*`, `**/*.spec.*` | TDD standards, assertion quality, test isolation |
| `api.md` | `routes/api.php`, `app/Http/Controllers/**` | RESTful conventions, auth patterns, error response shapes |
| `migrations.md` | `database/migrations/**`, `prisma/**` | Migration safety rules, reversibility, index naming |

Stack-relevant rules are detected and deployed automatically during `/sk:setup-claude` and `/sk:setup-optimizer`.

---

## Pick Your Flow

| I want to... | Run this | What happens |
|--------------|----------|-------------|
| **Not sure — let ShipKit decide** | `/sk:start` | Classifies your task, routes to optimal flow/mode/agents |
| **Build a new feature** | `/sk:brainstorm` | Full workflow: plan → TDD → quality gates → PR |
| **Build hands-free** | `/sk:autopilot` | All 8 steps, auto-skip, auto-advance, auto-commit |
| **Full-stack feature (parallel)** | `/sk:team` | Parallel domain agents (backend + frontend + QA) |
| **Make a small change** | `/sk:fast-track` | Skip planning, keep all quality gates |
| **Fix a bug** | `/sk:debug` | Investigate → regression test → fix → gates → PR |
| **Fix a production emergency** | `/sk:hotfix` | Skip TDD, but quality gates still enforced |
| **Handle a requirement change** | `/sk:change` | Assess scope, re-enter workflow at the right step |

---

## Workflows

### Feature Flow — full planning + TDD + all gates

> Start with: `/sk:brainstorm`

| Step | Command | What it does | Phase |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `/sk:brainstorm` | Explore requirements, propose approaches | Think |
| 2 | `/sk:frontend-design` or `/sk:api-design` | *Optional* — UI mockup or API contracts (includes accessibility) | Think |
| 3 | `/sk:write-plan` | Write decision-complete plan | Think |
| 4 | `/sk:branch` | Create feature branch | Build |
| 5 | `/sk:write-tests` + `/sk:execute-plan` | TDD: write failing tests, then implement | Build |
| 6 | `/sk:smart-commit` | Conventional commit | Build |
| 7 | `/sk:gates` | All 6 quality gates (parallel batches) | Verify |
| 8 | `/sk:finish-feature` | Update task, changelog, PR, feature sync, release | Ship |

---

### Fast-Track Flow — skip planning, keep all gates

> Start with: `/sk:fast-track`

| Step | Command | What it does | Phase |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `/sk:branch` | Create feature branch | Build |
| 2 | implement directly | No TDD — write code | Build |
| 3 | `/sk:smart-commit` | Conventional commit | Build |
| 4 | `/sk:gates` | All quality gates (parallel batches) | Verify |
| 5 | `/sk:finish-feature` | Changelog + PR | Ship |

Guard rails: warns if diff > 300 lines or > 5 new files.

---

### Bug Fix Flow — investigate first, then fix

> Start with: `/sk:debug`

| Step | Command | What it does | Phase |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `/sk:debug` | Reproduce, isolate, hypothesize, verify | Think |
| 2 | `/sk:branch` | Create fix branch | Build |
| 3 | `/sk:write-tests` | Regression test that reproduces the bug | Build |
| 4 | implement the fix | Make regression test pass | Build |
| 5 | `/sk:smart-commit` | Commit fix + test | Build |
| 6 | `/sk:gates` | All quality gates (parallel batches) | Verify |
| 7 | `/sk:finish-feature` | Changelog + PR | Ship |

---

### Hotfix Flow — production emergency

> Start with: `/sk:hotfix`

| Step | Command | What it does | Phase |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | `/sk:debug` | Root-cause analysis | Think |
| 2 | `/sk:branch` | Create hotfix branch | Build |
| 3 | implement directly | Fix the issue | Build |
| 4 | `/sk:smart-commit` | Commit the fix | Build |
| 5 | `/sk:gates` | All quality gates (parallel batches) | Verify |
| 6 | `/sk:finish-feature` | Changelog + PR (marked as hotfix) | Ship |

After merging: add regression test + lesson to `tasks/lessons.md`.

---

### Requirement Change — mid-workflow pivot

> Run: `/sk:change` — it classifies scope and re-enters at the right step

| Tier | What changed | Example | Re-entry point |
|------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | Behavior tweak (same scope) | "Delete all" → "Delete users only" | `/sk:write-tests` |
| **Tier 2** | New requirements (new scope) | "Also add export to CSV" | `/sk:write-plan` |
| **Tier 3** | Scope shift (rethink) | "Different approach entirely" | `/sk:brainstorm` |

---

## Quality Gates (`/sk:gates`)

One command runs all 6 gates in parallel batches:

| Batch | Gates | Why this order |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **1** (parallel) | lint + security + perf | Independent — run simultaneously |
| **2** | tests | Needs lint fixes first |
| **3** | code review | Needs deep understanding |
| **4** | E2E Tests | Needs review fixes |

Each gate auto-fixes and re-runs until clean. Fixes are squashed into one commit per gate pass. If a gate fails 3 times, it stops and asks for help.

Pre-existing issues are logged to `tasks/tech-debt.md` — not fixed inline.

---

| **Schema / ORM** | Prisma, Drizzle, Eloquent, SQLAlchemy, ActiveRecord |
| **Release** | npm, Composer, iOS (App Store), Android (Play Store) |

---

## Code Navigation (LSP)

ShipKit configures LSP (Language Server Protocol) automatically — giving Claude Code go-to-definition, find-references, hover, and diagnostics instead of plain text search.

**`/sk:setup-claude`** and **`/sk:setup-optimizer`** both run an LSP Integration step that:
- Sets `ENABLE_LSP_TOOL=1` in `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Detects your stack and installs the appropriate language server

| Stack | Language Server |
|-------|----------------|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | `typescript-language-server` |
| PHP | `intelephense` |
| Python | `pylsp` |
| Go | `gopls` |
| Rust | `rust-analyzer` |
| Swift | `sourcekit-lsp` |

**Rule:** Prefer LSP over `rg`/Grep for code navigation. Use `rg` only when LSP is unavailable or for arbitrary text/pattern matching.

---

## MCP Servers & Plugins

Both `/sk:setup-claude` and `/sk:setup-optimizer` offer to install three tools that enhance Claude Code's reasoning, knowledge, and session visibility. All are opt-in and idempotent.

### Sequential Thinking MCP

**Why it exists:** Complex problems — architecture decisions, multi-step debugging, tasks with many constraints — benefit from structured reasoning. Without it, Claude works through hard problems in a single pass, which can miss steps or lose track of constraints.

**What it does:** Gives Claude a dedicated reasoning scratchpad. It thinks through steps sequentially before responding, without cluttering your conversation with the intermediate work.

**Benefit:** More coherent, thorough responses on hard problems. Especially useful during `/sk:brainstorm`, `/sk:debug`, and `/sk:review`.

**How it's installed:** Adds `@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking` to `~/.mcp.json` (global, applies to all projects).

### Context7

**Why it exists:** Claude's training has a knowledge cutoff. When you're working with libraries that release frequently — React, Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui — Claude's suggestions can reference outdated APIs, deprecated methods, or patterns that no longer apply.

**What it does:** Fetches current, version-accurate documentation for libraries you're using and injects it into Claude's context at the moment it's needed.

**Benefit:** Accurate code suggestions for the actual version you're running. No more `useEffect` patterns from React 17 when you're on React 19.

**How it's installed:** Enables `context7@claude-plugins-official` in `~/.claude/settings.json`.

### ccstatusline

**Why it exists:** Knowing your context window %, active model, and current branch at a glance matters. Without it, you have to run `/sk:status` or guess when to `/compact`.

**What it does:** Adds a persistent statusline to the Claude Code CLI showing context window usage, active model, git branch, and current task.

**Benefit:** Always-visible session state. Know when you're approaching context limits before it becomes a problem.

**How it's installed:** Runs `npx ccstatusline@latest` which writes the statusline config to `~/.claude/settings.json`.

---

## Highest ROI Workflow — Using Every Feature

This is the recommended workflow that gets the most value from every ShipKit feature. It's not the fastest path — it's the most reliable path over the lifetime of a project.

### One-Time Project Setup (Do This Once)

```bash
# 1. Install ShipKit globally
npm install -g @kennethsolomon/shipkit && shipkit

# 2. Bootstrap your project
/sk:setup-claude
```

`/sk:setup-claude` deploys: CLAUDE.md, lifecycle hooks, 13 agent definitions, path-scoped rules, planning files, LSP config, MCP servers (Sequential Thinking, Context7), and ccstatusline.

```bash
# 3. Set up CI (once per repo)
/sk:ci
```

`/sk:ci` generates GitHub Actions workflows for auto PR review, issue triage, and nightly security audits. From this point on, every PR gets reviewed by Claude automatically.

### Session Start (Every Session)

The `session-start` hook fires automatically and loads: branch, recent commits, active task, tech debt, and code health. You see the session brief before you type anything.

If starting on an unfamiliar codebase:
```
/sk:reverse-doc architecture src/
```
`/sk:reverse-doc` reads your code and generates architecture documentation — maps layers, traces data flow, asks clarifying questions to distinguish intentional design from accidental implementation. Run it once when you join a codebase or after a long break.

### Feature Development (The Core Loop)

**Step 1 — Before writing the plan, use the `architect` agent on complex tasks:**
```
Use the architect agent: analyze the authentication system and propose an approach for adding OAuth
```
The `architect` agent reads your findings, lessons, and existing code — then proposes 2-3 options with trade-offs. This prevents architectural mistakes before a single line is written.

**Step 2 — For database changes, use the `database-architect` agent first:**
```
Use the database-architect agent: review the proposed users table changes
```
Gets you a migration safety classification (Safe / Careful / Breaking), index recommendations, and a deployment plan before `/sk:schema-migrate` runs.

**Step 3 — Run the standard workflow:**
```
/sk:start               ← classifies task, routes to optimal flow
/sk:brainstorm          ← explore requirements, extract checklist
/sk:write-plan          ← decision-complete plan (auto-generates contracts.md for API tasks)
/sk:branch              ← feature branch auto-named from task
/sk:write-tests         ← TDD red: failing tests first
/sk:execute-plan        ← TDD green: implement to pass tests
/sk:smart-commit        ← conventional commit with approval
/sk:gates               ← all 6 quality gates in parallel batches
/sk:finish-feature      ← changelog + PR + arch log
```

**For full-stack features — run `/sk:team` instead of execute-plan:**
```
/sk:team
```
Spawns `backend-dev`, `frontend-dev`, and `qa-engineer` in parallel worktrees. Backend implements the API, frontend mocks and builds UI, QA writes E2E scenarios — simultaneously. Results merge after all complete.

### During Gates — When Things Fail

**Perf gate fails with Critical issues:**
```
Use the performance-optimizer agent: fix the N+1 queries found in /sk:perf
```
The `performance-optimizer` agent reads `tasks/perf-findings.md`, implements fixes, and runs tests to confirm no regression. Works in an isolated worktree.

**Security gate blocks with High findings:**
```
Use the security-reviewer agent: audit the auth changes
```
The `security-reviewer` agent runs a focused OWASP audit. Its memory is `user`-scoped — it remembers security patterns across ALL your projects.

**Review gate blocks:**
```
Use the code-reviewer agent
```
7-dimension review: correctness, security, performance, reliability, design, best practices, testing. Tells you exactly what to fix.

### After Shipping

```
/sk:learn               ← extract reusable patterns from the session (confidence-scored)
/sk:retro               ← velocity, blockers, patterns, 3-5 action items
```

`/sk:learn` is the compounding step. Each session adds patterns that future sessions apply automatically. Over time, you stop repeating the same mistakes.

### Maintenance Workflows

**Codebase cleanup:**
```
Use the refactor-specialist agent: clean up the authentication module
```
The `refactor-specialist` runs tests before starting, makes behavior-preserving changes one at a time, runs tests after each change, and commits with `refactor(scope): description`. If tests go red, it reverts and reports.

**Documentation gaps:**
```
Use the tech-writer agent: document the payment service API
```
The `tech-writer` reads code first, never invents behavior, and produces README, API docs, or architecture docs in your project's existing style.

**Mobile store submission:**
```
Use the mobile-dev agent: prepare the iOS release
/sk:release --ios
```

**Infrastructure changes:**
```
Use the devops-engineer agent: set up Docker for local development
/sk:ci                  ← or update CI workflows
```

### Health Checks (Weekly/Monthly)

```
/sk:health              ← scorecard across 7 categories (0-70)
/sk:setup-optimizer     ← update CLAUDE.md, deploy missing agents/rules/hooks
```

`/sk:health` scores your project setup. `< 50` means you're leaving significant reliability on the table. `/sk:setup-optimizer` fixes the gaps.
